                    <h1>Instructions</h1>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Dear participant <span class="js-pid pid"></span>, please read the following instructions before the experiment.</p>
                    
                    <p>The purpose of this experiment is to gather information about the performances of two copy-paste techniques – the traditional Ctrl-C Ctrl-V keyboard shortcut and a new technique called AutoComPaste. In this experiment, you are going to complete a series of copy-paste tasks according to the requirements specified.</p>
                    
                    <br />
                    <h4>About the Interface</h4>
                    <p>The screenshot below illustrates a typical task interface.</p>
                    
                    <img src="img/screenshot_.jpg" alt="Interface screenshot" style="width: 700px">
                    
                    <p>The screen is split into two sections, the left section contains the conditions of the experiment while the right section contains the text editor window and the windows containing text.</p>
                    
                    <p>The left section defines the Technique to be used (AutoComPaste or traditional Ctrl-C Ctrl-V keyboard shortcut), Granularity (sentence, paragraph or phrase), Number of Article Windows and Trial number for the current task.</p>

                    <p>The words in the red box are called the stimuli, which is the target text that you have to enter into the Text Editor window using one of the two techniques. Please refrain from typing the required text in manually!</p>
                    
                    <p>The right section consists of two kinds of windows: one Text Editor window and several Article windows. The Text Editor window is where you should paste the stimuli in order to complete the task. The stimuli exists in one of the Article windows and it will be highlighted in yellow for easy identification in the cases of the TRADITIONAL copy-pasting technique. If you do not see highlighted text at first glance, try scrolling down/right in each Article window. </p>

                    <br />
                    <h4>About the Task</h4>
                    <p>As mentioned, your job is to copy-paste the stimuli into the Text Editor window using one of the two techniques. </p>
                    
                    <p>To use the traditional Ctrl-C Ctrl-V technique, select the stimuli in the Ariticles window and press "Ctrl" key and "C" simultaneously, then place your cursor inside the Text Editor window and press "Ctrl" key and "V" simultaneously.</p>
                    
                    <p>To use the AutoComPaste technique, ensure your Text Editor window is focused and type three characters or more. A dropdown list of possible sentences that contain the characters/sentence that you have just entered will appear. Pressing the ↑/↓ buttons on the keyboard will scroll through the list of suggestions. Press Enter to select a suggestion and the text editor will display the full selected <b>sentence</b>.</p>
                    
                    <p>You may then delete unnecessary words for Phrase tasks, or continue to append more sentences for Paragraph tasks. After you are satisfied with the text entered in the Text Editor window, press "Next Task" button in the left section to load the next task. Please note that the text entered should have no leading or trailing space.</p>

                    <p>For each task, a timer will start immediately when a new task is loaded and end when "Next Task" button is pressed. However, there is no need to rush through the tasks and compromise accuracy for speed.</p>
                    
                    <br />
                    <h4>Ready?</h4>
                    
                    <p>Now you have learned more about how the interface and the two copy-pasting techniques work, we have 3 blocks of 54 tasks for you, with a short break in between every two blocks. But before that, here are some untimed trials to familiarise yourself with the tasks. </p>
